========

R code for formatting/manipulating US Census Bureau Business Patterns Data by Zip Code (1998-2012).
The census bureau files are HUGE so melting and recasting take a while. Be forewarned.
1998 is the first year the census started using NAICS instead of SIC for industry codes.

This code was used in performing time-series analysis on this business patterns data for NYC zipcodes
for my final project in a GIS/Spatial Data class.
